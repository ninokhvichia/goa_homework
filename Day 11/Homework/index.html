    <p>Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae (which also includes
         the hares), which is in the order Lagomorpha (which also includes 
         pikas). The European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus is the ancestor 
         of the world's hundreds of breeds of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus 
         includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of 
         cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every
          continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a
           wild prey animal, a domesticated form of livestock and a pet. With 
           its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, in many areas of 
           the world, the rabbit is a part of daily life as food, clothing,
            a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.</p>
